/**
 * BroadcastManager
 *
 * This service is responsible for extracting dynamic broadcast configuration from Modularity
 * events based on a given model. It instantiates event classes (which extend the common ModelEvent)
 * and groups their broadcast channel names (from broadcastOn) together with the events (from broadcastAs).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   // For example, using events from SystemNotification module:
 *   use Modules\SystemNotification\Events\ModelCreated;
 *   use Modules\SystemNotification\Events\ModelUpdated;
 *
 *   $config = BroadcastManage::forModel($model, [
 *       ModelCreated::class,
 *       ModelUpdated::class,
 *   ]);
 *
 * The resulting $config array can then be passed to your global JS store (for example via the Blade footer)
 * to let laravel-echo subscribe dynamically.
